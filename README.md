# CPP Star-Numbers Pattern

It is an updated repo, the previous one uploaded was having some bugs which I have to figure out, that require some time as well. This repo has almost 30+ Stars & Numbers Pattern source code for __C++__.

## Requirements

- OS : Windows (Preferably), Linux , Mac-OS 

- C++ Compiler : MINGW-W64 (Recommended), [Download Here](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/)

- Any Text Editor or IDE : VS-Code (Recommended), [Download Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

> Da, all done here, now compile the source code and test it out.

> **NOTE:** _Any add ups are  welcome and do file a PR if you find any error._
